# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
# Define a tuple with letters and numbers
x = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'n', 5, 8, 12)

# Check if 'n' is in the tuple
if 'n' in x:
    print("'n' is present in the tuple.")
else:
    print("'n' is not present in the tuple.")

# Check if 8 is in the tuple
if 8 in x:
    print("8 is present in the tuple.")
else:
    print("8 is not present in the tuple.")
```
